# Goal
In this project, we aim to build a modular deep learning system for multi-task learning that can simultaneously perform disease grading (multi-class classification) and lesion segmentation (binary or multi-label) from retinal images. The system should be capable of handling both single-task learning and multi-task learning scenarios.
